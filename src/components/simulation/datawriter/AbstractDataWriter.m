classdef AbstractDataWriter < handle & matlab.mixin.Heterogeneous
	% This class sets out the required functions for writing
	% data to file

	% This will usually be used for something like storing the spatial
	% positions of the nodes etc for later visualisation. In other words
	% it is designed for use when each time step will produce a lot of
	% data, rather than just a handful of values

	properties
		% A structure that holds the data for a single
		% time step. This will be a cell array for each type of
		% data held by the concrete class. It can take matrices
		% or cell arrays. Each row of the matrix or cell array should
		% contain all the data about a single unit that is being stored
		% for example, if storing nodes, each row should be data for a
		% single node
		data

		% The corresponding time point
		timePoint

		% How many steps between each data point
		samplingMultiple

		% How many significant figures to store
		precision = 5

		% A flag to determine if each time step will be written to a
		% separate file, or all will be written in a single file
		multipleFiles = true

		% If writing multiple files, each file needs a unique number
		% so we need to keep track of where we're up to
		fileNumber = 0

		% A path pointing to where the data will be stored
		rootStorageLocation

		% A flag to tell the function that the full path has been made
		% i.e. using mkdir
		fullPathMade = false

		% The full path to the folder where the data will be written
		fullPath

		% A flag to determine if a time stamp is added to the start of each line
		timeStampNeeded = true

	end

	properties (Abstract)

		% A name for the file(s) to be written. This will be given in
		% a cell array, and the file names will match with the data
		% in the matching data cell array
		fileNames

		% The sub directory structure under the root storage location
		% Should be at minimum be 'simname/' and can also go deeper
		% with parameter sets etc. 
		subdirectoryStructure
