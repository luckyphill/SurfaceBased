classdef NodeCellCycleSlowGrowth < AbstractCellCycleModel
	% A cell cycle for node cells

	% This cell cycle is specifcally for NodeCells where the
	% growth happens after a new node is introduced.
	% This means that the actual growth is represented by controlling
	% separation between the two cells
